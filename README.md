# 🧩 LeetCode Post-Submission Evaluation Levels

After each LeetCode submission, grade yourself from **0–4** using this table.  
If your score is **below 2**, **redo the problem within 1–2 days**.  
If your score is **3 or higher**, **save it as a reference** — it’s a model solution.

| Level | Name | Definition | LeetCode Submit Result | Score | Runtime / Memory Criteria | Logic & Code Quality |
|:------|:------|:------------|:------------------------|:------:|:--------------------------|:---------------------|
| **L0 – Wrong / Error** | ❌ **Incorrect** | The code doesn’t compile, crashes, or produces wrong results. | ❌ Wrong Answer / Runtime Error / Compilation Error | **0** | – N/A (code fails)<br>– TLE or CE | – Syntax or logic errors.<br>– Missing edge cases or broken logic. |
| **L1 – Accepted (Basic)** | ✅ **Works but not solid** | Passes all test cases but is inefficient or messy. | ✅ Accepted (but high runtime/memory) | **1** | – Runtime: *Beats <30% users*<br>– Memory: *Beats <30% users* | – Brute-force logic or redundant loops.<br>– Overuse of conditions.<br>– Not optimal in time or space complexity. |
| **L2 – Efficient Solution** | ⚙️ **Optimized logic** | Correct and runs efficiently. | ✅ Accepted + Good Performance | **2** | – Runtime: *Beats 40–60% users*<br>– Memory: *Beats 40–60% users* | – Uses proper data structures/algorithms (hash map, stack, two pointers, DP, etc.).<br>– No brute-force logic.<br>– Code is stable and understandable. |
| **L3 – Clean & Elegant Code** | ✨ **Readable and reusable** | Optimal, well-structured, and easy to reuse. | ✅ Accepted + Well-structured code | **3** | – Runtime: *Beats 60–80% users*<br>– Memory: *Beats 60–80% users* | – Clear naming, concise structure.<br>– Can serve as a clean template.<br>– Handles all edge cases gracefully. |
| **L4 – Pattern Mastery / Expert Level** | 🧠 **Fully internalized** | You’ve mastered the core pattern and can re-solve it quickly. | ✅ Accepted + Can re-solve and explain pattern | **4** | – Runtime: *Beats ≥80% users*<br>– Memory: *Beats ≥80% users* | – Pattern fully internalized (sliding window, binary search on answer, monotonic stack, DFS pruning, etc.).<br>– Can explain and code from scratch in minutes.<br>– Teachable-quality solution. |

## ⚡ How to Use

1. **After every submission**, assign yourself a score from **0–4**.  
2. If **<2**, **redo the problem within 1–2 days** — focus on improving logic or efficiency.  
3. If **≥3**, **save it** as a **reference or template**.  
4. Long-term goal: **70% of problems ≥ L3**, **30% ≥ L4**.
