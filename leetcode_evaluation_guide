# 🧩 LeetCode Post-Submission Evaluation Levels

| Level | Name | Definition |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **L0 – Wrong / Error** | ❌ Incorrect | The code doesn’t compile, crashes, or produces wrong results. |
| **L1 – Accepted (Basic)** | ✅ Works but not solid | Passes all test cases, but:<br>– Logic is brute-force or inefficient.<br>– Code is messy or overly conditional.<br>– Doesn’t meet optimal time/space complexity. |
| **L2 – Efficient Solution** | ⚙️ Optimized logic | Correct and runs efficiently.<br>Uses the right data structures or algorithms (e.g. hash map, stack, two pointers, DP, etc.). |
| **L3 – Clean & Elegant Code** | ✨ Readable and reusable | In addition to being optimal, the code:<br>– Is concise and clear.<br>– Uses meaningful names and structure.<br>– Could be used as a reference or template. |
| **L4 – Pattern Mastery / Expert Level** | 🧠 Fully internalized | You’ve mastered the problem’s **underlying pattern** (e.g. sliding window, binary search on answer, monotonic stack).<br>Can re-solve it in minutes and explain it confidently. |

## ⚡ How to Use

1. After each submission, **grade yourself 0–4** based on the table above.  
2. If your score is **below 2**, redo the problem within 1–2 days.  
3. If it’s **3 or higher**, save it as a reference and note the key pattern.
